### How to Create a New Post

1. Create a new folder within the `content/posts` directory. The folder name can be anything (e.g., `my-new-post`).
2. Inside the folder, create a file named `index.md`.
3. Add the following frontmatter at the beginning of the `index.md` file, enclosed by triple dashes (---):
   ```yaml
   title: "My New Blog Post"
   date: 2023-10-27
   tags: ["technology", "blogging"]
   description: "A brief description of your post." 
   featuredImage: "/path/to/featured-image.jpg" 
   ```
4.  Write your post content below the frontmatter using Markdown syntax.

### How to Customize Post Metadata

The frontmatter section of your post (enclosed by `---`) allows you to customize various aspects of your post, such as the title, date, tags, description, and featured image.

| Metadata Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `title` | The title of your post. |
| `date` | The publication date of your post (YYYY-MM-DD). |
| `tags` | An array of tags associated with the post. |
| `description` | A brief description of your post, used for meta descriptions and social media sharing. |
| `featuredImage` | The path to the featured image for your post. |


### How to Add Translations

1.  Create a copy of your post's `index.md` file in the same folder.
2.  Rename the copied file using the ISO language code (e.g., `index.fr.md` for French).
3.  Translate the content of the copied file.


### How to Change Themes

Themes are located in the `src/styles/themes` directory. You can customize or create your own theme by following the examples provided.  Import the desired theme in your `src/styles/index.scss` file.
